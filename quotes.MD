So many new people to working out worry about routine or the perfect diet and get overwhelmed by what bodybuilders and athletes do and nitpick.

It doesn't matter. For 99% of the population, if you train sub-par for 4 years you'll be in better shape than someone who tried to do everything perfect but burnt themselves out after a year

An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar. The first one orders a beer. The second one orders half a beer. The third one orders a fourth of a beer. The bartender stops them, pours two beers and says, "You guys should know your limits."

 What's the related joke again... something like: 

A QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a ueicbksjdhd. 

First real customer walks in and asks where the bathroom is. The bar bursts into flames, killing everyone.

The whole battle between Adam and Eva is representing two philosophers: Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche. Both are quoted in the show. And the overall concept discussed in the series is free will vs. causal determinism.

Albert Einstein once wrote this: "I do not believe in free will. Schopenhauer's words: 'Man can do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wants' accompany me in all situations throughout my life and reconcile me with the actions of others, even if they are rather painful to me. This awareness of the lack of free will keeps me from taking myself and my fellow men too seriously as acting and deciding individuals, and from losing my temper." Schopenhauer's clearer, actual words were: "You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can will only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing."

Schopenhauer's view of the world is pessimistic, just like Adam's view of his world. Every longing comes out of needing and wanting, and it is pain, as long as it's not satisfied. But no satisfaction is eternal, it is just the beginning of a new longing. The biggest proof of this is the neverending, never-to-be fully satisfied sex drive. Life is an eternal recurrence. Both philisophers subscribe to a cyclical view of time, in which there can be déjà-vu (a sort of awareness that you are in a repeating cycle). According to Schopenhauer, only art (especially music) and one's morals can enable one to overcome this frustrating and painful way of being, and reach a state of nirvana. The philosopher Baruch de Spinoza put it like this: "Human freedom can be achieved through knowledge of the causes that determine our desire and affections. Acting out of our own internal necessity is genuine freedom, while being driven by exterior determinations is akin to bondage."

Adam tries to achieve absolute annihilation, because just like Schopenhauer, he sees life as suffering which is worth escaping, even by ending one's own existance. Since he can't kill himself, he wanted to end the cycle altogether. He made one crucial mistake though: He was still guided by the will/want, and he still guided (or rather manipulated) others by what they will/want. What he needed to have done is to get rid of all will/want/desire, until he has no reason to act anymore. That would've likely broken the cycle.

Eva, on the other hand, is more on the Nietzsche side of things. She also realizes that she is in a cycle of eternally recurring suffering. But she doesn't want to escape the cycle by annihilation, she wants to preserve it. She wants everyone to live again and again, because she chooses pain over nothingness, and because she wants her child, the Origin, to live. That's why she said, choosing Adam means choosing death, choosing her means choosing life. She doesn't want to reach a "nirvana", she wants to uphold the cycle, the "samsara".

Schopenhauer wins in the end. Only Claudia finds out the truth about it all, making Jonas and Martha collaborate and sacrifice themselves for the others in the origin world to live. In the origin world, we hear Hannah describe the dream that she had. That everything faded to nothing and that it was somehow good that way.

Quoting Spinoza again: Human servitude is a state of bondage of the man who is aware of his own desires, but ignorant of the causes that determined him. On the other hand, the free or virtuous man becomes capable, through reason and knowledge, to be genuinely free, even as he is being "determined".

This is why we never venture to the surface. For above the middle tier only madness you will find. Much better to stay here in darkness, comforted by the warmth of server threads and database I/O. Sometimes when you hold very still you can hear patterns in the data. They whisper to me, like a long forgotten melody. Here a man can be a king, a king of shadows.
